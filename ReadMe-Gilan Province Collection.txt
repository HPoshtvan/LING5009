    <overview>
        <description>
            This project has been conducted within the context of the ALI research program. The aim is to record and document the language varieties of Gilan Province, located on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran. Gilan hosts both Iranic and non-Iranic languages from the Caspian dialect group, Tatic group, Northwestern Iranian, Southwestern Iranian, Turkic, and Persian. All language varieties in this region are at risk of shift or change, as Persian, the only national language, proceeds to take over throughout the province. As a result, the province's linguistic diversity is rapidly shifting to a monolithic Persian block.

            The linguistic data, collected through an extensive period of field research throughout the province, aims to expand linguistic knowledge of the region by providing fresh, first-hand data from the diverse language varieties spoken by the diverse communities. This data enables interested parties (including linguists, geographers, cartographers, etc.) to research more deeply into this province. It also provides community members with resources for educational purposes.
